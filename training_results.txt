Neural Network Training Results (1/30):

Regular Neural Net, no Fast MM:
Over 10 Networks, each trained for 50 epochs
Average final test accuracy: 97.401%
Average epoch where 97% test accuracy was reached: 32.0

1 Step of Strassen
Over 10 Networks, each trained for 50 epochs
Average final test accuracy: 97.417%
Average epoch where 97% test accuracy was reached: 31.6

2 Steps of Strassen
Over 10 Networks, each trained for 50 epochs
Average final test accuracy: 97.413%
Average epoch where 97% test accuracy was reached: 31.9
(Took about 40 minutes)

Keep track at average test acc at each epoch and then plot that

The above training accuracy is not a good measure because it is only calculated using a single batch and is not representative of the entire set
